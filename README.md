Problem statement :- In today’s interconnected world, supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions and extreme weather events pose significant challenges to global stability and public welfare. These disruptions lead to severe shortages of essential goods, such as food, medical supplies, and critical infrastructure components, adversely affecting vulnerable populations and industries alike. Rising costs and limited access to resources further exacerbate food insecurity, hinder healthcare services, and fuel broader economic instability, creating ripple effects across communities.
Moreover, traditional supply chain systems often lack transparency, adaptability, and predictive capabilities, making it difficult to respond quickly and effectively to sudden disruptions. Addressing these issues requires robust, scalable, and secure technological solutions tailored to global supply chain challenges.
Our project leverages the power of IBM zSystems, incorporating key technologies such as IBM’s z/OS, DB2, Watson AI, and Snap ML to build a highly resilient supply chain solution. Using Watson X, we will deploy machine learning models for real-time predictive analytics to forecast potential disruptions and optimize resource allocation strategies. Additionally, blockchain technology via Hyperledger Fabric on IBM z will ensure secure, end-to-end transparency across the supply chain. IBM Cloud Pak for Data will facilitate data-driven decision-making, while IBM’s Sysplex architecture provides high availability and scalability for critical supply chain operations.
This framework ensures equitable access to essential goods, reduces disruptions, and builds long-term resilience
